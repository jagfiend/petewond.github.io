It's time to start a blog... I have randomly decided. Well perhaps not so randomly. For the last few years I have had lots of things I wanted to explore more outside of my day job and now is as good a time as any even though I don't believe in making New Year's resolutions as such. Rather than setting big goals and then not doing anything to achieve them I prefer to have a few areas that I want to improve on and then incrementally work at those a little every day or two. Those little increments hopefully add up over time into meeting bigger goals anyway.

Rambling intro aside. This year I would like to learn and build some new things (or old things in new ways). Broadly I want to:

+ Improve my backend skills and become more of a specialist in this area.
+ Learn Python to challenge myself technically and work with a language that's quite different to what I'm used to.
+ Dive dive into topics like API development, approaches to developing larger projects and better understanding the tools I'm using day to day.

My first idea for something I have been meaning to build for awhile is a dojo management system. I think building this in both Django and a Laravel stack so I can compare and contrast as I go will be a good way to begin!
